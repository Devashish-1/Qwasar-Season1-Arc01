# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit directory and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit file(s).



## Description

The Mastermind solution separates code into main.c, mastermind.c, and mastermind.h. A Makefile automates compilation with gcc. Header file defines functions. main.c manages game logic, while mastermind.c implements core functions. make compiles the program, creating my_mastermind. The solution adheres to specified requirements and organization.

## Installation
To run the code, you'll need a development environment with a C compiler installed, such as GCC. Here are the steps first is Install GCC,If you don't have GCC installed, you can install it on Linux using your package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install gcc) or on macOS through Xcode Command Line Tools. For Windows, you can use MinGW or Cygwin.second is Create file,third is Open Terminal or Command Prompt and fourth is Compile the Code and at last Run the Executable by this command ./my_mastermind -c "0123"


## Usage
This C code implements a text-based Mastermind game. Compile using `make` and run with optional arguments (`-c` for secret code, `-t` for attempts). Input guesses and receive feedback on well-placed and misplaced pieces. The game ends when the code is guessed correctly or after a set number of attempts.
