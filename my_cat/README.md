# Welcome to My Cat
***

## Task
For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit directory and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit file(s).

## Description
Here's how I solved the problem of implementing the my_cat program in C in steps so my first step is understanding the problem than second is Identifying the required functions and third is Implementing the logic and fourth is by handling errors and than last by testing and veryfying my code

## Installation
The provided code is written in C, and therefore doesn't require any specific installation process like npm install or make.Here's how to "install" and run the code so first compile the code ,There are two main ways to compile the code ,first by command line second is IDE than run the program . Additionally, you can run the code in most C development environments like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, etc. These environments often provide convenient features for compiling and running C programs.

## Usage
Overall, this code provides a basic but functional implementation of the my_cat program. It allows you to easily read and display the content of multiple files from the command line. While it lacks advanced features, it serves its purpose efficiently and demonstrates good coding practices in C.
